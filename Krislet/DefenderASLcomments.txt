-- Goal:
(I wish I could comment asl, I'm sure there is a way)

1. Kick the ball to center field, this way rambo can pick it up.
    Precon: Be on Ball, see center
2. Get to the ball
    Precon: Be close to ball, see ball
3. Get to a defensive position
    Precon: Have a known defensive position
4. Set a defensive position
    -> decided to hardcode this
5. Else: Generic search (spin) / wait for info.


Note: The three defenders should be identical, up until the last two plans.
This is why they are separated by some whitespace, it's just the conditions to enter that change.
I'm not sure how to do variables and set them cleanly within our framework,
which is why we came up with this hardcoded solution at the moment.
